## 🤔 **WAIT, WHAT DOES THIS DO?**

This tells Vercel to automatically serve HTML files without the `.html` extension.

So:
- `/flow-assessment.html` becomes accessible at `/flow-assessment`
- `/procrastination-assessment.html` becomes accessible at `/procrastination-assessment`

## ⏱️ **WAIT 2 MINUTES**

Vercel will automatically redeploy. Then try:
```
https://cogskills-assessments.vercel.app/flow-assessment
https://cogskills-assessments.vercel.app/procrastination-assessment
```

## 🎯 **ALTERNATIVE (If that doesn't work):**

If the above doesn't work, we can just update your URLs to include the full filename. It's not as clean, but it works:

**Your assessment URLs would be:**
```
https://cogskills-assessments.vercel.app/flow-assessment.html
https://cogskills-assessments.vercel.app/procrastination-assessment.html
